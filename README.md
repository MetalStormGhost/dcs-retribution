## About DCS Retribution
DCS Retribution was forked from [DCS Liberation](https://github.com/dcs-retribution/dcs-retribution),
which is a [DCS World](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/products/world/) turn based single-player or co-op dynamic campaign. 
It is an external program that generates full and complex DCS missions and manage a persistent combat environment.

DCS Retribution will rely heavily on Liberation in the near future,
and possibly in a more distant future as well since Retribution will attempt
to stay backwards compatible for as long as possible. Therefore,
the patreon link will keep pointing to [Khopa's](https://github.com/Khopa) account until further notice.

Currently, Retribution supports the following new features:
 * A livery selector in the air wing configuration dialog
 * Support for campaigns with quad-point triggers
 * Support for the F-15D 'Baz' mod
 * Support for the Su-30 mod
 * Elementary end-game mechanics
 * Variation in flight-size for BAI/ANTISHIP/DEAD/STRIKE main flight (randomize 2/3/4-ships)
 * More performance options
 * Various bug-fixes (including a fix for the zombie carrier)
 * And more... (See [changelog](https://github.com/dcs-retribution/dcs-retribution/blob/main/changelog.md))

## Roadmap

Our plans for future releases can be found on our
[Projects page](https://github.com/dcs-retribution/dcs-retribution/projects).
Each planned release has a Project, and the page for that project has columns for to do,
in progress, and done. Items in the Done column are in the
[preview build](https://github.com/dcs-retribution/dcs-retribution/wiki/Betas)
for that release. Items in the To do column are planned to be added to that release.

## Resources

Tutorials, contributors and developer's guides are available in the project's
[Wiki](https://github.com/dcs-retribution/dcs-retribution/wiki/)

(These need to be written again, meanwhile you can refer to
[Liberation's Wiki](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/wiki/))

## Special Thanks

First, a big thanks to shdwp, for starting the original DCS Liberation project. 

Then, DCS Liberation/Retribution uses [pydcs](https://github.com/pydcs/dcs) for mission generation, and nothing would be possible without this.
It also uses the popular [Mist](https://github.com/mrSkortch/MissionScriptingTools) lua framework for mission scripting.

Excellent lua scripts DCS Liberation/Retribution uses as plugins:

* For the JTAC feature, DCS Retribution embeds Ciribob's JTAC Autolase [script](https://github.com/ciribob/DCS-JTACAutoLaze).
* Walder's [Skynet-IADS](https://github.com/walder/Skynet-IADS) is used for Integrated Air Defense System.

Please also show some support to these projects !
