description: The T-62 is a Soviet main battle tank that was first introduced in 1961.
  As a further development of the T-55 series, the T-62 retained many similar design
  elements of its predecessor including low profile and thick turret armour. In
  contrast with previous tanks, which were armed with rifled tank guns, the T-62 was
  the first production tank armed with a smoothbore tank gun that could fire APFSDS
  rounds at higher velocities.
