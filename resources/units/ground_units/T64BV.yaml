class: Tank
description: The T-64 is a Soviet second-generation main battle tank, designed by
  Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau in Ukraine, introduced in the early
  1960s. It was a more advanced counterpart to the T-62; the T-64 served in tank
  divisions, while the T-62 supported infantry in motorized rifle divisions. It
  introduced a number of advanced features including composite armour, a compact
  engine and transmission, and a smoothbore 125-mm gun equipped with an autoloader
  to allow the crew to be reduced to three so the tank could be smaller and lighter.
  In spite of being armed and armoured like a heavy tank, the T-64 weighed only 38
  tonnes (42 short tons; 37 long tons).
